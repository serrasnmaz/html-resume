<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Serra, I was born on July 26, 1999 in Edirne, Turkey. I am 24 years old now. 
  After completing my high school education at Edirne Yıldırım Beyazıt Anatolian High School, I graduated from Eskişehir Technical University, Department of Chemical Engineering.
   I am currently living in Tekirdag province. 
   I have been working as a quality control engineer at Lila Paper Factory for a year.</p>

<p>During my work experience of more than a year, I gained experiences such as teamwork, team management, leadership and work discipline. 
  And here I had the opportunity to take part in and lead many improvement efforts. 
  Among these opportunities, I realized my predisposition to the software and IT sector and started to plan my career in this direction.</p>

<p>You can find all the work I have done in my journey to become a Front End Developer on this website.
   I constantly try to keep myself up to date on my journey to become a front end developer, follow innovations, 
   and expand my portfolio with new projects.</p>

  <p>
    I am willing to take the challenge to improve my IT skills. 
    My biggest wish in my new career goal is to use the technical knowledge I have acquired 
    and will acquire to benefit other people and organizations.
